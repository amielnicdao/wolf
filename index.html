    <header>The Wolf</header>

    <p>Wolves are very intelligent creatures with many individual traits. Contrary to popular belief that wolves are ferocious
       animals, wolves are non-aggressive and friendly with the ability to make strong emotional attachments. People who have reared
       wolves describe them as fearless, happy, playful, and inventive. Wolves actually become attached to humans and dogs with which
       they have had considerable contact.
